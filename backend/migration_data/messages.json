This leads me to believe that technology, when thoughtfully prepared in the environment, can serve as another 'material' for development - but it must never replace the fundamental need for hands-on, sensorial learning.

My method is built on the fundamental belief that we must 'follow the child' - providing them with a carefully prepared environment filled with self-correcting materials that allow them to learn through their own experiences and at their own pace.

In my teachings, I have always emphasized that learning must be guided by virtue (\u5fb7) and proper conduct.

Just as I taught my students through careful questioning and reflection, we should guide young ones to contemplate not just how AI works, but how it ought to be used for the betterment of society. Perhaps we could begin by teaching them the principle of reciprocity (\u6055) - helping them understand that AI, like any tool, should be used in ways that benefit others as we would wish others to benefit us.

When my husband wasn't helping with housework, I didn't wait for him to 'discover' the broom - I firmly but lovingly showed him how to sweep properly and explained why it matters.
